# HW3-Word-Guess-Game

## Introduction:
This game was built as the third homework assignment for NU Coding Bootcamp. The instructions were to develop a hangman game.

## Instructions:
* Start the game by pressing any key. A random word will be chosen for the player to guess. An incorrectly guessed letter will subtract your number of guesses remaining by 1. 
* Duplicate letter guesses will not count against you. Run out of guesses and you lose. A new word will be chosen for you. 
* Should you guess correctly, you will gain a "Win" point, and a new word will be chosen for you to guess, with the number of guesses remaining resetting.
